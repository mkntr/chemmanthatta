# Chemmanthatta

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.2.
It is for the temple chemmanthatta mahadeva temple at Thrissur (trichur). It is developed using bootstrap and angular.
Most of the components are generic and thus could be reused with replacing the content in a easy manner.
Responsive to mobile and desktop versions. 
The intention of such project is to develop software that would facilitate most of the temples in Kerala.
